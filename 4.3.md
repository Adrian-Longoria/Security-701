# **Explaining various activities associated with vulnerability management.**

**–Identification methods–**

**\- Vulnerability scan:** A Vulnerability scan is a process in which computers, networks, applications, for any weak points. Such as unsafe passwords, outdated software, and or misconfigured settings.

**\- Application security:** Application security refers to the process of adding, testing and implementing security features for apps.  
	**\-Static analysis:** Static analysis, also known as static application security testing (SAST) is the process of debugging code that is done by looking through the code without running the program.  
**\-Dynamic analysis:** Dynamic analysis, also known as dynamic application security testing (DAST). Is the process of debugging a program while it's running. In order to find out bugs that only occur when the program is executed.  
**\-Package monitoring:** Package monitoring is the process of tracking and looking through third-party packages in order to determine what they do, and if they pose any sort of risk.

**\-Threat feed:** A stream of data that shows current cybersecurity threats.  
**\-Open-source intelligence (OSINT):** Open-source intelligence is the process of collecting publicly available data from the internet, in order to gain a better understanding of cyber security threats.   
	**\-Proprietary/third-party:** Proprietary refers to data being owned by its respective owner. The owner can do what they please with their date. While Third party refers to data owned by someone else.   
**\-Information-sharing:** refers to the practice of companies/organizations sharing what data they have on cyber security threats, so that they may gain a better understanding of the threats.

**\-Organization:** Refers to companies, groups or governmental bodies  
**\- Dark web:** The dark web is a part of the internet that is available through special software such as Tor.  
**\- Penetration testing:** Penetration testing is the act of hacking into a network in order to expose its weak points.   
**\- Responsible disclosure program:** A responsible disclosure program is a way to report vulnerabilities, and bugs in a network or program to the organization that owns it.  
**\- Bug bounty program:** A bug bounty program is a way in which organizations can pay or reward people for fixing, or discovering a bug or vulnerability.   
**\- System/process audit:** a system/process audit is a review of an organization's procedures, and systems. Basically a self evaluation on how they run the operation.

**–Analysis–**

**\- Confirmation:** the action of verifying whether something is correct.   
	**\-False positive:** a false positive can happen when a security system incorrectly thinks that a safe program is malicious or unsafe.   
**\-False negative:** a false negative can occur if a security system fails to correctly catch a virus or malicious software, deeming it safe when it's actually not.

**\- Prioritize:** to make a specific action or project the priority.

**\- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):** a common industry standard for assessing how severe a vulnerability is. The scale goes like this: Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Informational.

**\- Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE):** A CVE is, in short; a list of commonly known security flaws and vulnerabilities.   
**\- Vulnerability classification:** a scale that scores how severe a security flaw or vulnerability is.   
**\- Exposure factor:** exposure factor is the percentage of a lost asset caused by an incident. For example if a company phone gets stolen and is never retrieved, then 100% of the data on that phone is lost or destroyed.   
**\- Environmental variables:** variables that are stored within an operating system or app that can affect the behavior of a system or application.  
**\- Industry/organizational impact:** The effect or changes that a security breach can have on an organization or the industry as a whole.  
**\- Risk tolerance:** how much risk of loss an organization is able to take 

**• Vulnerability response and Remediation**  
**\- Patching:** applying a small update or fix to an application or system.   
**\- Insurance:** cyber insurance is an insurance policy for things like cyber attacks or data breaches.   
**\- Segmentation:** the practice of dividing networks or systems into smaller parts, in order to protect other networks or systems.    
**\- Compensating controls:** compensating controls are security settings that are put in place in order to meet security requirements, when a primary setting or control cannot be used.  
**\- Exceptions and exemptions:**   
	\-**Exception:** An exception is a permission to bypass a security policy  
	\-**Exemption:** a permission to block a security policy  
**• Validation of remediation**  
**\- Rescanning:** running a security scan again. Rescanning is often done after fixing a vulnerability.  
**\- Audit:** an analysis of threats or vulnerabilities  
**\- Verification:** confirming the accuracy of a system or network  
**• Reporting**
